## Description

This project was created to apply my advanced CSS skills including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The motive behind this was to apply these techniques to familiarize myself with them so they come more natural to me in the future and that I can make webpages as visually appealing as possible.

## Usage

To Use this webpage is simple. To see it's interactivity, adjust the screen size and see how the contents adjust/ move around.
